## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## makeCacheMatrix creates a special matrix object, and then cacheSolve 
## calculates the inverse of the matrix.
## If the matrix inverse has already been calculated, it will  
## find it in the cache and return it, and not calculate it again.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
inv = NULL
        set = function(y) {
                # use `<<-` to assign a value to an object in an environment 
                # different from the current environment. 
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL
        }
        
        get = function() x
        setinv = function(inverse) inv <<- inverse 
        getinv = function() inv
        list(set=set, get=get, setinv=setinv, getinv=getinv)
}


## The function cacheSolve returns the inverse of a matrix A created with
## the makeCacheMatrix function.
## If the cached inverse is available, cacheSolve retrieves it, while if
## not, it computes, caches, and returns it.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
      
        inv = x$getinv()
        
        # if the inverse has already been calculated
        if (!is.null(inv)){
                # get it from the cache and skips the computation. 
                message("getting cached data")
                return(inv)
        }
        
        # otherwise, calculates the inverse 
        mat.data = x$get()
        inv = solve(mat.data, ...)
        
        # sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinv function.
        x$setinv(inv)
        
        return(inv)
